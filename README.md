Hey! Welcome to Viola's Stamp, a guide to where Viola might've gone to support Black businesses in Toronto. The idea for this was inspired by a conversation in the Black Toronto Facebook group. Locations can be added to the community map by simply entering an address in the search bar. Feel free to message us suggestions and additions <a href="https://www.mypaere.com/contact-us">here</a>. 
Coded by Lequanne as a<a href="https://www.mypaere.com"> PAERE</a> project.
